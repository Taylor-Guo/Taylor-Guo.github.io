Abstract
Dexterity and tactile sensing have been the key challenges for robotic grippers to interact with everyday objects of various shapes and sizes, such as grasping and manipulation. A reconfigurable mechanism with a multi-fingered design enables grippers to perform multiple grasping gestures for different objects. Moreover, tactile feedback is needed to facilitate the grasping and manipulation tasks for a larger range of objects with closed-loop control. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a reconfigurable multi-fingered gripper with integrated tactile sensing capabilities. In this letter, we present a robotic gripper with a reconfigurable mechanism and biomimetic tactile sensors integrated into the fingers and palm. Our gripper with four adaptive fingers can perform 5 grasping gestures and obtain 228 tactile feedback signals (normal and shear forces) in 150 Hz. We show that the gripper can grasp various everyday objects and achieve in-hand manipulation including translation and rotation with closed-loop control. This research provides a new hardware design and could be beneficial to various robotic applications in the domestic and industrial fields.
