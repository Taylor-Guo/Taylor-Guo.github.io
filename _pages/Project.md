**Keywords**: Multifingered Hands, Tactile Sensing, Reconfigurable Gripper, Grasping Evaluation, Robotic Manipulation.

Comments: This gripper was designed to **improve the drawbacks of first prototype**, where thin objects cannot be handled or even manipulated. Meanwhile, efforts were made to explore the utilization of **Graph-based Neural Networks to deal with arbitrarily structured data**, such as time-varying gripper configurations.
