* (Robotics) Design of A Compact Multi-Modal Vision-based Tactile Thumb with Dexterous Origami Joints (In progress)
======
**Overview of the system Design**, the manufacturing of Optical Waveguides refers to [zhao, 2016](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.aai7529):

**Artificial Intelligence**: I am now implementing the **Encoder-Decoder Generative Model** to handle the obtained tactile images.

**Remarks**: I am also exploring using **origami-based** hollow structures as an alternative to conventional robotic finger joints, enabling enhanced dexterity of the finger.

**Keywords**: Multifingered Hands, Tactile Sensing, Reconfigurable Gripper, Grasping Evaluation, Robotic Manipulation.

**Comments**: This gripper was designed to **improve the drawbacks of first prototype**, where thin objects cannot be handled or even manipulated. Meanwhile, efforts were made to explore the utilization of **Graph-based Neural Networks to deal with arbitrarily structured data**, such as time-varying gripper configurations.
